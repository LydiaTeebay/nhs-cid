    <p>The registration details you used to prove who you are have changed.</p>
    <p>This may be because:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>you have changed your GP surgery</li>
    	<li>your GP surgery has changed GP systems</li>
    	<li>your GP surgery has merged with another or split</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Speak to your GP to get updated registration details or <a href="../../service-access/pb/service-access-photo-id-interuption{{ params }}">use photo I.D. to prove who you are instead.</a></p>
    <p>Other websites and apps may allow you to log in without new registration details. Some may allow limited access until your details have been updated.</p>
