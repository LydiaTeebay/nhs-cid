                        <li>In order to access certain content, systems or interactive features on this website you may be asked to choose, or be provided with, a password or other log in details to access parts of this website. As a minimum, passwords you set for use with this website must have a level of complexity which ensures they cannot be easily guessed by hackers or malicious software.  They should:
                            <ul>
                                <li>be at least twelve characters long;</li>
                                <li>not contain your user name, real name, or organisation name;</li>
                                <li>not appear in the <a href="http://www.passwordrandom.com/most-popular-passwords">list of top 10,000 passwords</a>;</li>
                                <li>not use sequential key characters on the keyboard (e.g. qwerty, asdfg, 12345)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>In line with Government best practice, we recommend using the ‘three random words’ approach, which uses three or more randomly chosen words like ‘saloonbadgertree’ or ‘coffeetrainfish’.  These words should be random, and not related personally to you (so not involving a favourite thing, holiday, relative). Passwords must not under any circumstances be shared with anyone.</li>
                        <li>You may terminate your account registration using the relevant link in your account pages. This will clear any personal information you have saved. Subscriptions to our emails can be terminated using the ‘Unsubscribe’ links provided in the emails.</li>
