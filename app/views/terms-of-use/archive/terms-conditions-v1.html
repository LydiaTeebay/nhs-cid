		<li><b>About these terms</b>

				<li>The <abbr>CID</abbr> Platform and the Service is intended for use only by people who live in England. References to 'the <abbr>NHS</abbr>' mean 'the <abbr>NHS</abbr> in England' unless otherwise stated. Services and arrangements may differ elsewhere in the UK.</li>

By accepting these terms and conditions you accept that these terms and conditions and all other notices and policies referred to herein may change from time to time, and accept such  changes.</li>
				<li>We are able to terminate the <abbr>CID</abbr> Platform at any time without any liability to you. Whether such termination would impact your continued use of the Service and any other services that sit under the <abbr>CID</abbr> Platform will be dependent upon the terms and availability of each particular service.</li>
				<li>To the extent that we are practically able to do so, we may terminate your access to any part of the Service or any other services you are using under the <abbr>CID</abbr> Platform at any time without notice if you breach any of these terms and conditions.</li>
				<li>By using the <abbr>CID</abbr> Platform for the purposes of verifying your identity, we make no promises that such verification will be adequate to enable you to use the Service and any other services that sit under the <abbr>CID</abbr> Platform. Service providers may require additional verification for their own purposes and the <abbr>NHS</abbr> verification standards and requirements may change in the future. As such, we make no commitment as to what the verification will allow you access to and for how long.</li>
