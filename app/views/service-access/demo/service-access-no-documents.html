  <h1 class="">Sorry - you cannot continue</h1>

  <p>We need a photo of your UK driving licence or UK passport to prove who you are. This is the only ID we can accept at the moment.</p>

  <!--div class="callout callout--info">
    <h2 class="h3">What you can do instead</h2>
    <p>You can prove who you are at your GP surgery.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ask to use your GP surgery's online services. You'll need to fill in a form and prove who you are.</li>
      <li>Your surgery will send you some registration details. The details you need are different to your username and password for your surgery's online services. You need:
        <ul>
          <li>Linkage Key (could be called a Passphrase)</li>
          <li>O.D.S. Code (could be called an Organisation Code or Practice I.D.)</li>
          <li>Account I.D.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you've already asked to use your surgery's online services, you might have the details on a letter.</p>

      </li>
      <li>Come back and log in with your NHS login. You'll be asked to enter the details your surgery gave you.</li>
    </ol>
