  <h1 class="">Sorry - you cannot continue</h1>

  <p>We need to see a photo of your ID to check that the information on your ID matches your NHS record.</p>

  <p>We can only accept UK driving licences and UK passports at the moment.</p>

  <h2 class="h3">What you can do instead</h2>

  <ol>
    <li> Ask your GP surgery to register you for their online services - they will give you some registration details.</li>
    <li>Log in to the NHS App using your NHS login.</li>
    <li>Use the details that your surgery gave you.</li>
  </ol>
