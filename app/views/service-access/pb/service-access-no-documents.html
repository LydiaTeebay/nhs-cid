  <h1 class="">Sorry - you cannot continue</h1>

  <p>We need to see a photo of your ID so that we can check the information on your ID matches your NHS record.</p>

  <p>We can only accept UK driving licences and UK passports at the moment.

  <h2 class="h3">What you can do instead</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Ask your GP surgery to register you for their online services.</li>
    <li>Your GP will give you some details that let you book appointments online.</li>
    <li>Log in to the NHS App using your NHS login.</li>
    <li>Use the details that your GP gave you so that we can connect you to your GP.</li>
  </ol>
