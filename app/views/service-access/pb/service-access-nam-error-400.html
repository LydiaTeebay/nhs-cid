    <p>Please speak to someone at your GP surgery.</p>

            <h3>Another way to connect your NHS login to your GP surgery</h3>
            <p>Ask your GP surgery for your registration details for GP online services (this is different from the username and password used to access the service). Your details might include things called a linkage key, O.D.S code and account ID.</p>
            <p>When you have these details, log in again and click the button below.</p>
